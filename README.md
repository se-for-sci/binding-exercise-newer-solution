# Binding Exercise.

To complete this homework, finish these two files:

- CMakeLists.txt (add the skbuild branch)
- src/\_core.cpp (add the binding definition)

Each requires about 5 lines of code added. Hint: you only need to bind the final
class, HarmonicOscillator; no need to teach pybind11 about anything else.
Lists/tuples autoconvert to std::vector, and Eigen autoconverts to numpy (due to
the includes I've added at the top).

There's a C++ version you can compile directly and compare with
`cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && ./build/main`. Tests, noxfile,
etc. have been provided.
